# UES-lookup

This prototype is made up of 2 parts

1. Static html prototype of the School Lookup, within src folder
2. A mock API server found in the api folder.

To work correctly the prototype relies on the mock api running - otherwise the ajax requests will never hit an endpoint.

The mock api runs as a node server and so there are specific steps to install and run this.

## Install
1. Make sure you have node installed
2. Then on the command line enter the api folder
3. Run the following command: 'npm install' - this will install all dependencies
4. Install nodemon by running the following command: 'npm install -g nodemon'

## Running the server
1. On the command line enter the api folder
2. Run the following command to start the app - 'npm start'
